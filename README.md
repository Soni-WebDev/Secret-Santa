# Secret Santa Assignment

## Overview

This application automates the process of assigning secret children to employees based on the provided employee information. Users can upload a CSV file (in the format: name, email id) to generate Secret Santa details. If a previous year's CSV file is provided, the application ensures that the same Secret Santa pairings are not repeated.
